That's partially because it appears people who set realistic goals actually work more efficiently, and exert more effort, to achieve those goals. \nWhat are far less understood by scientists, however, are the potentially harmful effects of goal-setting. There has been surprisingly little research on how the practice may have contributed to the current economic crisis and unethical  behavior in general.\n\"Goals are widely used and promoted as having really beneficial effects. And yet, the same motivation that can push people to exert more effort in a constructive way could also motivate people to be more likely to engage in unethical behaviors,\" says Maurice Schweitzer, an associate professor of operations and information management at Penn's Wharton School. His paper, titled \"Goals Gone Wild: The Systematic Side Effects of Over-Prescribing Goal Setting,\" appears in the February issue of the Academy of Management Perspectives.\n \"It turns out there's no economic benefit to just having a goal-you just get a psychological benefit and that's quite motivating in itself,\" Schweitzer says. \"But in many cases, goals have economic rewards that make them more powerful.\"\nA prime example Schweitzer and his colleagues give is the 2004 closing down of energy-trading titan Enron, where managers used financial rewards to motivate salesmen to meet specific sales goals. The problem, Schweitzer says, is the actual trades were not earning money. Other studies have shown that pressing employees with unrealistic goals can force them to lie, cheat or steal. Such was the case, Schweitzer says, in the early 1990s when Sears imposed a sales target on its auto repair staff. It resulted in employees overcharging for work and completing unnecessary repairs on a companywide basis.\nSchweitzer admits his research run against a very large body of literature that praises the many benefits of goal-setting. Edwin A. Locke, from the University of Maryland, College Park, and Gary P. Latham, from the University of Toronto, write: \"Goal setting is not going away. Organizations cannot develop without being focused on their desired results any more than an individual can develop without goals to provide a sense of purpose.\"\nThe debate is likely to be popular on in future papers, and the practice of setting goals no doubt will continue. For now, though, the lesson seems to be to put more thought into setting goals. \"They really do help to coordinate and motivate people. My idea would be to combine that with careful observation, a strong organizational culture, and make sure the goals that you use are going to be constructive and not significantly harm the organization,\" Schweitzer says.", "question": "What message does the author try to get across about goal-setting?", "option": "Its role has been largely underestimated.", "label": false, "valid_question": true, "valid_option": true, "conversion_success": true, "exception": false, "hypothesis": "The author tries to get its role has been largely underestimated across about goal - setting."}, {"id": "high20306.txt_1_A", "premise": "If you're into sports, you've seen it happen.

You demonstrate good sportsmanship when you show respect for yourself, your teammates, and your opponents, for the coaches on both sides, and for the referees, judges, and other officials.\nBut sportsmanship isn't just reserved for the people on the field. Cheerleaders and fans also need to be aware of how they behave during competition. Sportsmanship is a style and an attitude; and it can have a positive influence on everyone around you.\nLearning good sportsmanship means finding that the positive attitude learned on the field carries over into other areas of life. At school, for example, you're able to appreciate the contributions made by classmates and know how to work as part of a team to complete a project.

Dirty rain, called acid rain is also bad for plants, animals and buildings. Scientists say that in 30 years, more than half of the people in the world won't have enough clean water. We have to learn how to stop wasting water. One of the first steps is to develop ways of reusing it. Today in most large cities, water is used only once and then sent out into a sewer system  . From there it returns to the sea or goes underground.\nBut even though every large city reused its water, we would still not have enough.

After hard practice, by the time school started that year I'd gotten the hang of it. I was happy in my new work. I became a combination of chauffeur, nurse and friend. And if the kids needed it, I'd put on my \"Tough Big Sister\" act. It was a lot like my previous job---being a mom.\nWhen I think about my years of bus driving, many things crowded in, but mostly, I remember Charlie.\nCharlie, eight years old, with blond hair and crystalline gray eyes, began riding my bus in September of my fourth year driving. They all had stories to tell me about their summers. Charlie, though, ignored me. He didn't even answer when I asked his name.\nFrom that day on, Charlie was a trial. If a fight broke out I didn't have to turn my head to know who had started it. If someone was throwing spitballs I could guess the culprit's name. If a girl was crying, chances were Charlie had pulled her hair. No matter how I spoke to him, gently or firmly, he wouldn't say a word. He'd just stare at me with those big gray eyes of his.\nI asked around some, and found out Charlie's father was dead and he didn't live with his mother. He deserves my patience, I thought. So I practiced every bit of patience I could muster. To my cheery \"Good Morning\", he was silent. When I wished him a happy Halloween, he sneered. Many, many times I asked God how I could reach Charlie. \"I'm at my wit's end.\" I'd say. Still I was sure that this child needed to feel some warmth from me. So, when he'd pass by, I'd ruffle his hair or pat him on the arm.\nToward the end of that year, the kids on my bus gave me a small trophy inscribed \"To the Best Bus Driver Ever\". I propped it up on the dashboard. On top I hung a small tin heart that a little girl had given me. In red paint she had written, \"I love Polly and Polly loves me.\"\nOn the next-to-last day of school I was delayed a few minutes talking to the principal. When I got on the bus I realized that the tin heart was gone. \"Does anyone know what happened to the little heart that was up here?\" I asked. For once with 39 children, there was silence.\nOne boy piped up, \"Charlie was the first one on the bus. I bet  he took it.\" Other children joined the chorus, \"Yeah! Charlie did it! Search him!\" I asked Charlie, \"Have you seen the heart?\"\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he protested . Standing up, he took a few pennies and a small ball out of his pockets. \"See, I don't have it.\"\n\"I bet he does!\" insisted the girl who had given me the heart. \"Check his pockets.\"\nCharlie glowered when I asked him to come forward. His gaze burned into mine. I stuck my hand into one pocket. Nothing. I reached into the other pocket. Then I felt it ---the familiar outline of the small tin heart. Charlie stared at me for a long time. There were no tears in those big gray eyes, no plea  for mercy. _ I was about to pull the tin heart out of Charlie's pocket when I stopped myself. Let him keep it, a voice seemed to whisper.\n\"It must have fallen off before I got here,\" I said to the kids. \"I'll probably find it back at the depot.\" Without a word, Charlie returned to his seat. When he got off at his stop, he didn't so much as glance at me.\nThat summer Charlie moved away.\nEventually I retired. And there my story as a school bus driver ends, except for one more incident. A dozen years after retirement I was in a department store in Kansas City, when someone said tentatively, \"Polly?\"\nI turned to see a balding  man who was approaching middle age. \"Yes?\"\nHis face didn't look familiar until I noticed his big gray eyes. There was no doubt. It was Charlie.\nHe told me he was living in Montana and doing well. Then, to my surprise, he hugged me. After he let go, he pulled something from his pocket and held it up for me to see. An old key chain....bent out of shape, the lettering faded. You can probably guess what it was---the little tin heart that said, \"I love Polly and Polly loves me.\"\n\"You were the only one who kept trying,\" he explained.

And according to town manager Leslie Stanley, it doesn't look as if things will improve any in the immediate future. \"We've got a real annoying problem on our hands,\" he says.\nThe annoyance began in late May. About three miles outside of town a group of beavers   built a dam near the mouth of a culvert   that carries a stream under Canaan Road. Some 50 feet of roadway and several hundred feet of land on each side of the culvert were flooded. Stanley sent a road crew out to level the dam. The beavers rebuilt it. The crew tore it apart again. In fact, they tore it apart for ten mornings-and for ten straight nights the beavers rebuilt it.\nOn the eleventh day, the foreman tossed   the problem back to the town manager. He, in turn, tossed it on to the local game warden  . The warden, absorbed in beaver knowledge, moved quietly and carefully out one night and placed a petrol-soaked bag over the dam. (Any beaver expert will tell you the creatures just can't tolerate petrol smell.)\nIn the morning the bag was found artistically woven   into the dam.\nThe warden set out three steel traps that night. In the morning one was empty. The other two had been stolen by the beavers and used to strengthen the dam. The warden, cursing the state law against hunting beavers with firearms, got his traps back and set them out again and again. And every night the beavers stole them.\nTown manager Stanley enlisted additional troops. He telephoned his police chief. Those beavers were breaking a state law against blocking up a natural watercourse. \"Why aren't you out there to _ the law?\" Stanley asked. \"You're the police chief. So remove them. Arrest them. Do something.\"\nThree mornings later, the police chief proudly announced the end of the dam. At 2:00 A.M., he said, he and a licensed dynamiter   had blown it to small pieces. Stanley said he'd believe it when he saw it.\nThey drove out to the culvert and found a new dam already half-built. They also found the highway choked with mud and remains thrown up by the dynamite.\nStanley said maybe they should call in the Army Corps of Engineers. But the police chief's faith in explosives was unshaken. He launched an all-out campaign,but the beavers always managed to have the holes plugged by the time the fire department appeared on the scene for its morning mop-up.\nIn time, the beavers tired of this nonsense and moved their dam \"inside\" the culvert-where it couldn't be blown up without destroying the road too.\nStanley and his general staff held a council of war and agreed that fresh strategy was called for. Then they came up with an inspired idea. If we remove every branch of the dam by hand, we'll force the beavers to go in search of new building material to replace what we've taken. Then we can place box traps along their runways and seized them.\nThe plan was completely approved. Moreover it worked. On July 30, town manager Stanley was able to announce that the beaver group had been trapped and removed to a remote wilderness area. And there was great joy in Hampden-until the middle of October, that is, when a group of young beavers was spotted swimming in the same waters from which its elders had recently been taken away.\nBut to make a long story short, the strategy that worked with the older beavers worked with the young ones too.", "question": "What was the annoying problem for the authorities in Hampden, Maine?", "option": "They failed to destroy the dam repeatedly built by the beavers.", "label": true, "valid_question": true, "valid_option": true, "conversion_success": true, "exception": false, "hypothesis": "The annoying problem for the authorities in Hampden, Maine was they failed to destroy the dam repeatedly built by the beavers."}, {"id": "high5181.txt_0_A", "premise": "Look, this is the first plane in the world to be created using the new technology of \"3D printing\".
