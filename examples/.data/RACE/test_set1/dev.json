Large rocks, pebbles, and sand cover much of the surface. Plants called lichen   grow on the rocks, and where there is enough soil, grass, flowers, and even small bushes manage to live. No trees can grow on Eskimo land, so geographers sometimes call it the Arctic plains. There are some animals in Eskimo land, such as rabbits, which eat the plants. Other animals, like the white fox and the gray wolf, eat the rabbits. The Eskimo is a meat-eater, too, and may even eat a wolf when food is scarce.\nThe Eskimo year has two main parts: a long, cold winter and a short, cool summer. Spring and fall are almost too short to be noticed. Summer is the best time, as food is usually plentiful. But it is also the time when Eskimos are very busy. Winter is never far away, and the men must bring home extra meat for the women to prepare and store, for seldom can enough animals be killed in winter to feed a family.\nThe Far North is sometimes called the land of the midnight sun. This is true in the middle of summer, for between April 21st and August 21st the sun never sets in Northern Greenland. But in midwinter the Far North is a land with no sunshine at all. Around Oct. 21st the Eskimos of Northern Greenland see the sun set directly south of them, and they don't see it again until February 22nd.

Some top-end restaurants will add a 10% service charge to the bill. If not, waiters will appreciate you tacking on  the 10% yourself. However, if you're eating at a lower-end  restaurant a tip is not necessary. If you're staying at one of Bangkok's many five-star hotels, expect to tip the porter 20 to 50 baht , depending on how many bags you have. Taxis are now metered in Bangkok. Local custom is to round the fare  up to the nearest five baht.\nHong Kong\nTipping is customary in this money-mad metropolis . Most restaurants add a 10% service charge to the bill, but the extra money often ends up in the pocket of the owner. If the service is good, add another 10% to the bill, up to HK $100 in an especially nice restaurant. For HK $10 hotel porters should do it at all but the nicest hotels where a new HK $20 bill may be more acceptable. When in a taxi, round up  to the nearest dollar.\nKuala Lumpur\nTipping in Malaysia is limited to the expensive Westernized hotels, which often add a 10% service charge to your meal or hotel room. If you are at a hotel restaurant, expect a 10% service charge. But at local restaurants, there's no need to add a tip. At five-star hotels, one or two ringgit  will content a porter. At lower-end buildings don't feel you have to tip. Like Bangkok, many taxis are now metered so you can just round up to the nearest ringgit.\nSeoul\nTipping is not part of Korean culture, although it has become a matter of course in international hotels where a 10% service charge is often added. If you're at a Korean barbecue joint , there's no need to add anything extra. But a nice Italian restaurant may require a 10% contribution. If you're at a top-end hotel, so expect to pay 500~1 000 won per bag. Taxi drivers don't accept a tip.

He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.\nWhat if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.\nPlay, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.\nExperts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level.

The results are similar, according to an article on February 7 in the Guardian, a famous British newspaper.\nIn one experiment, scientists told young children that they could either have a marshmallow  now, or two marshmallows in 15 minutes. Waiting obviously needed more willpower. Scientists then continued studying the children as they grew up. They wanted to see if some children always had stronger willpower. They also wanted to see how having stronger willpower affected their lives.\nYears later, scientists found that the children who had waited for two marshmallows were all healthier, happier and richer adults. Oppositely, the children who had shown weaker willpower at that young age were more likely to be in low-paid jobs, to be overweight, to have social problems.\nBut there is hope, Roy F Baumeister, an American social psychology  professor  told the Guardian. Baumeister says we can train our willpower just like we train our muscles.  Even a little practice can strengthen our overall self-control if we do it regularly.\nYou could start by making yourself stand up straight, speaking in complete sentences, or using a computer mouse with the other hand. Scientists have found that people who manage to change little habits often perform much better in laboratory willpower tests.\nLike muscles, willpower can 'get tired'.

French became the language of the upper classes of society. And it remained that way for 300 years. Only these high society people could afford to eat meat. As a result, French words like porc (pork) and beouf (beef) came into the English language. However, poor English farmers raised the animals.

The course titles will be Yoga for Teenagers; Hip Hop Dance: Learning the Latest Moves; and Creative Journaling for Teens: Discovering the Writer Within. The latter course will not be held at the Allendale Cultural Center but instead will meet at the Allendale Public Library.\nStaff member Tricia Cousins will teach the yoga and hip hop classes. Ms. Cousins is an accomplished choreographer   as well as an experienced dance educator. She has an MA in dance education from Teachers College, Columbia University, where she wrote a thesis on the pedagogical   effectiveness of dance education. The journaling class will be taught by Betsy Milford. Ms. Milford is the head librarian at the Allendale Public Library as well as a columnist for the professional journal Library Focus.\nThe courses are part of the Allendale Cultural Center's Project Teen, which was initiated by Leah Martin, Director of the Cultural Center. According to Martin, this project is a direct result of her efforts to make the center a more essential part of the Allendale community. Over the last several years, the number of people who have visited the cultural center for classes or events has steadily declined. Project Teen is primarily funded by a generous grant from The McGee Arts Foundation, an organization devoted to bringing arts programs to young adults. Martin oversees the Project Teen board, which consists of five board members. Two board members are students at Allendale's Brookdale High School; the other three are adults with backgrounds in education and the arts.\nThe creative journaling class will be cosponsored by Brookdale High School, and students who complete the class will be given the opportunity to publish one of their journal entries in Pulse, Brookdale's student literary magazine. Students who complete the hip hop class will be eligible to participate in the Allendale Review, an annual concert sponsored by the cultural center that features local actors, musicians, and dancers. All classes are scheduled to begin immediately following school dismissal, and transportation will be available from Brookdale High School to the Allendale Cultural Center and the Allendale Public Library.

Among the planet's inhabitants(,),the one that has the most similarities with humans is the Na'vi, and it is the struggle between the Ma'vi and human invaders  that forms the story of the film.\nAs to the factors  leading to the film's success, many think that the entertaining feast  for the eyes and the wonderful story shouldn't be forgotten, but the new language invented especially for the film which provides audiences with a new experience also plays an important part.\nIn order to increase the truthfulness of an alien race , the film's director James Cameron asked an expert in languages from the University of Southern California to invent a language for the Na'vi. Professor Paul Frommer combined the languages spoken among Indians, Africans and mid-Asians and worked with James Caneron for four years to create the Na'vi language based on the original 30 words that the director had already come up with.\nAccording to Professor Frommer, the most important characteristic of the Na'vi language is that it could be pronounced. \"This is an alien language but obviously it has to be spoken by human actors and actresses,\" Professor Frommer told the BBC, \"it has to sound natural and it should make human beings comfortable when using it.\"\nThe language has a vocabulary of around 1000 words but Professor Formmer hopes to enlarge the vocabulary in possible follow-ups to the film and in video games.

In 1998, they were proven completely wrong. Though it flies in the face of scientific theory, the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. \nOne possible explanation is that empty space has a thing called dark energy, which supposedly makes up about three quarters of the universe. Dark energy supposedly very sparsely  exists in such a way that it interacts with other objects only through attracting force. It has a strong negative pressure, which causes it to pull on its surroundings and as a result, pull apart the universe. This neatly explains the universe's expansion without completely changing our understanding of the universe. Scientists can merely claim that dark energy \"should\" exist. \nAccording to Einstein's theory of relativity, it is impossible to travel faster than at the speed of light. \nWith this in mind, physicists set out to do the impossible and succeeded. In 2000, scientists in Princeton, New Jersey sent a small pulse  of laser light through a vapor made up of gaseous cesium . The pulse traveled so quickly that it was already leaving the vapor-filled chamber as it was still entering, roughly 300 times faster than it would have in a vacuum . Thus, light moved faster than the speed of light. \nOther experiments have since managed to conquer light's supposed speed limit, though all claims have had fine print that keeps them from being especially groundbreaking .

One would certainly think otherwise; selecting and putting up our trees have always been filled with risk.\nFor example, one afternoon dangerously close to Christmas Eve _ , a glorious tree that was so full and tall that we could hardly get it into the house. Once we did, my father immediately realized that we would have to hire a carpenter to build a stand for it.\nAnother December, perhaps the very next one, we bought a tree earlier than we ever had before. We were happy with its shape and delighted that its size was manageable. We easily placed it in a stand, decorated it from top to bottom, and then self-satisfiedly sat back by the fire in its soft light.\nTwo or three days passed and the truth could not be hidden; we had bought a tree cut so long ago that its needles were coming off. There was nothing to do but undecorated it, take it down, and begin tree shopping again.\nOur most recent Christmas tree offered still another difficult task. When we brought it home, once again it seemed larger than it was in the great outdoors. To complicate matters, we had bought a new stand, one whose nuts and bolts worked more mysteriously than those of our old stands. I persuaded two young neighbors to stop playing basketball and to help us get the tree into the house and set it correctly in the stand. Unfortunately, no one noticed the mud on our helpers' shoes, so only after removing several reddish brown sports from the carpet were we able to discuss the question of where the lights and ornaments were stored. Perhaps those who cut their own trees have tales more painful than these.

In front of the chairs are deep sinks with a showerhead and long metal pipe attached to the taps, not that anyone seems to use them. Behind the sinks are mirrors and on either side of these, shelves overflowing with all types of plastic combs, shaving mugs, scissors, cut throat razors, hair brushes and, 10 bright red bottles of Brylcreem , piled neatly in a pyramid.

Readers may sometimes think writers have first-hand experience of it. I have collected some of the popular ways in which time travel is made possible in science fiction:\n* Through the wormhole -- A wormhole is a path between points in space-time. According to Einstein, an object can pass through a wormhole if it can travel at the speed of light. An example of a wormhole is described in Riddle of the Red Bible.\n* Through a black hole -- A black hole is a vacuum   in space where light cannot even escape or pass through. In some sci-fi movies, like Star Trek, black holes became the means to travel through time.\n* Through time machines -- In science fiction, time machines are vehicles that can travel faster than light. It can be a strange vehicle like the TARDIS in Doctor Who or a special car like the one used in Back to the Future. But these special vehicles would need a wormhole to travel to the past or the future.\n* Through parallel universe   -- Another popular way to travel through time is to be able to get into a parallel universe where one can go back to a point in time and see a different reality.\nThough we know time travel may not be possible, it is still an entertaining subject and a heated topic for most of us.
